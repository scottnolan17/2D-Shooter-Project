# 2D-Shooter-Project

This was one of my final projects for my Intro to Game Development course. The assignment was to create a top-down, old-school 2D shooter as a solo project in C++ from scratch.

Features in this project:
  - Physics-based controls and particles
  - Custom artwork
  - 2D animations
  - Customizable and scaling difficulty
  - Menus with score tracking
